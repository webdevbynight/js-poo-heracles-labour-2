# Labours of Heracles #2: the boar of Erymanthe

This repository is an exercise suggested by my instructor as an autonomous work during a course at Wild Code School.

To run, just type: `node index.js` in your terminal. You do not need to add any dependencies: the `package.json` file is just here for Node uses the ES module system.
